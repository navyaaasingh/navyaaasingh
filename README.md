## 👋 About Me

I’m a highly motivated learner with a strong interest in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, focused on building practical, well-structured projects that translate theory into real-world applications. I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, systems, and problem-solving**, and I’m actively developing the skills required to design scalable and reliable ML solutions. My goal is to combine both StreetStyle and AI. Instead of letting AI taking over, we should learn how to get the best of both the worlds. 

🔭 **I’m currently working on**  
End-to-end AI/ML projects involving data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and experimentation, with an emphasis on clean code, reproducibility, and meaningful results.

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**  
Open-source AI/ML projects, research-inspired implementations, LLM-based applications, and tools that combine data-driven insights with strong engineering practices.

🤝 **I’m looking for help with**  
MLOps fundamentals, model deployment strategies, system design for ML pipelines, and improving the performance and interpretability of models.

🌱 **I’m currently learning**  
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, PyTorch, core Data Structures & Algorithms, and the foundational concepts behind scalable ML systems.

💬 **Ask me about**  
AI/ML fundamentals, beginner-friendly project ideas, model training workflows, translating research into code, and building consistent learning systems.

🧠 **Core strengths**  
Analytical thinking • Structured problem-solving • Fast learner • Strong fundamentals • Clear technical communication

⚡ **Fun fact**  
I approach AI as an engineering discipline — prioritizing data quality, assumptions, and system design over hype.
